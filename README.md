Only make use you use the images given in the dataset rather than using any other public images. That is if a problem has limited dataset that is a constraint and you have to develop a algorithm optimal with respect to the constraint


**Good image**

so this Bacis model, to find image defected, its helps to find the defet on uploded image,
